# graphql scalars for metacentre

This is a secret-stack plugin that passes graphql typedefs and resolvers for commonly needed scalars not specified in the graphql spec.

The vast majority of these scalars are unused, however they will be needed down the track. Rather than have devs implemement their own types we include these now to ensure consistency and agreement.

See [graphql-scalars](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-scalars)
